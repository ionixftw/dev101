### Aryan
Around 5th century B.C. Arans pushed into Bengal from the western side.
It took them about 1000 years to take whole command of Bengal.
Because of feeble influence pre-Aryan elements in the culture of the people got time to be rooted deeply.
Stone tools indicate the  earliest evidence of human settlements.
Pre-historic implements have been discovered in various parts of West Bengal in the districs of Midnapur, Bankura, Burdwan.
The archaeological discoveries in 1960's bear evidence that, around 1000 B.C. there was a comparatively higher degree of civilisation in certain parts of Bangladesh. 
'Pandu Rajar Dhibi' near Ajay river in the Burdwan district, represents the ruins of trading township, which carried on trade both internally and externally.
