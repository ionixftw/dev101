# Aryan
Around 5th century B.C. Aryans pushed into Bengal from the western side.

It took them about 1000 years to take whole command of Bengal.

Because of feeble influence, pre-Aryan elements in the culture of the people got time to be rooted deeply.

Stone tools indicate the  earliest evidence of human settlements.

Pre-historic implements have been discovered in various parts of West Bengal in the districs of Midnapur, Bankura, Burdwan.

The archaeological discoveries in 1960's bear evidence that, around 1000 B.C. there was a comparatively higher degree of civilisation in certain parts of Bangladesh. Atlthough Aryans descibed existing inhabitants as Barbarians, they were in fact much more civilised.

'Pandu Rajar Dhibi' near Ajay river in the Burdwan district, represents the ruins of trading township, which carried on trade both internally and externally.

An inscription written in Brahmi script found in excavation at Mahasthana (formerly known as Pundranagar) in Bogra district is the earliest epigraphic record in Bangladesh and it bears testimony of Maurya rule ( 3rd century B.C.).

The Brahmi script bears evidence of using relief measures such as paddy and money in times of calamities, strong mutual respect between administration and people, weaving fine cotton, terracota plaques.

# Gupta Rule

From the fall of the Mauryas( 2nd century B.C.) to the rise of the Guptas ( 4th century A.D.) Bengal continued to flourish in the Sunga and Kushna periods, that is ascertained by terracotta figurines found at Mahasthana, Tamralipti, and Chandraketugarh.

Circa 4th century A.D. , Under Gupta founder Samudragupta, Bengal remained divided into independent states. Around 450 A.D., all these states came under Samudragupta's rule except Samatata, which was a tributary state.

Chandragupta II ( successor of Samudragupta ) consolidated all their possessions in the east and wage wars against the Vangas.

Proper administration was present during Gupta rule, in which participation of local people in administrative tasks was encouraged.

Under a central government, peace, wealth, prosperity and political stability was ensured.

Trade and commerce also flourished during Gupta empire. The discovery of large number of Gupta coins bear testimony of economic prosperity.

Religion tolerance and coexistence of religious beliefs (Buddism, Jainism) is an unprecendent  
achievement of Gupta empire.

Artistic excellence of the Gupta School inspired the Bengal school of scruptural art.

# Sasanka Rule

* In 600 A.D. south and east Bengal became independent under local rulers and formed the kingdom of Vanga.

* In the central part of northern India the Maukharis rose to prominence but later Gupta's held sway over Bihar, western and northern Bangladesh. It lead to a lot of clashes between Gupta and the Maukharis for the possession of Magadha (souther Bihar) and parts of western and northern Bengal.

* Sasanka(master of northern and western Bengal with his empire extending as far as Chilka lake in Orissa) is the first king of Bengal to extend his suzerainty over territories far beyond the geographical boundaries of that province. By the beginning of 7th century A.D. Gauda emerged as an independent nation under Sasanka and Magadha formed a part of his dominions(শাসনকৃত এলাকা). He attempted at establishing a north Indian empire simultaneously keeping Gauda empire independent.

* Harshavardhana, who owned practically the whole north India and parts of southern India, was the powerful adversary of Sasanka.

* Sasanka's capital Karnasuvarna, is located at Rangamati, six miles southwest of Bahrampur in the Murshidabad district of India.

* Sasanka was staunch Shaivite ( follower of Shiva ) and said to be an anti-Buddhist. But this information came from one of his adversaries, so it is not genuine.

* He is the forerunner of agressive northern Indian policy of the later day Pala rulers like Dharmapala and Devpala.

# Matsyanyayam

* **Definition:** Matsyanyayam is a period of anarchy and lawlessness. When the law of punishment is kept in abeyance, it gives rise to such disorder as is implied in the proverb of fishes i.e. the larger fish swallows the small one, for in the absensce of law-enforcing authority, the strong will swallow the weak.

* Matsyanyayam lasted for a century ( 650 A.D. - 750 A.D. )

* The death of Sasanka initiated this period of lawlessness. Harshavardana died in 647 A.D. and the usurpation of his kingdom by his ministers created political chaos.

* Gopala emergerd to the helm of affairs in Bengal and succeeded in putting and end to the state of Matsyanyayam.

# The Pala Dynasty

* In 750 A.D., Gopala founded Pala dynasty, which lasted for four hundred years.

* The history of the long line of Pala rulers can be viewed under different phases:
   - Period of ascendancy
     - Dharmapala and Devpala
   - Period of stagnation
     - to be rejevuneted by Mahipala, who is considered to be the second founder of the dynasty.
   - Period of decline and disintegration
     - was halted by the vigorous rule of Ramapala.

* Under the vigorous rule of Devpala and Dharmapala, Bengal are was involved in a tripartite struggle with The Gurjara Pratiharas of western India and the Rashtrakutas of southern India. Northern India's traditional center seat at Kannauj was the main target of these three parties.

* Despite facing many reverses, Dharmapala succeeded in advancing his influence up to Kanauj. He also succeeded in maintaining his hold outside Bengal and Bihar.

* Dharmapala was a devoted Buddhist and credited with the foundation of the Vikramasila monastery.

* Somapura Mahavihar, at Paharpur ( in Naogaon district in Bangladesh), included in the 'Heritage of Man' of UNESCO, largest Buddhist monastery in the Indian subcontinent ( about 1000 feet square), is another monumental architechtural work of Dharmapala.

* Devapala, the successor of Dharmapala, continued to pursue supremacy of northern India (specially Kanauj), which was later conquered by Gurjara Pratiharas.

* Dharmapala and Devapala consolidated their empire in northern and western Bengal.

# The Sena Dynasty

* Towards the end of the 12th century A.D., Vijayasena founded the Sena empire.
