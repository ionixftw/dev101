# Aryan
Around 5th century B.C. Aryans pushed into Bengal from the western side.

It took them about 1000 years to take whole command of Bengal.

Because of feeble influence, pre-Aryan elements in the culture of the people got time to be rooted deeply.

Stone tools indicate the  earliest evidence of human settlements.

Pre-historic implements have been discovered in various parts of West Bengal in the districs of Midnapur, Bankura, Burdwan.

The archaeological discoveries in 1960's bear evidence that, around 1000 B.C. there was a comparatively higher degree of civilisation in certain parts of Bangladesh. Atlthough Aryans descibed existing inhabitants as Barbarians, they were in fact much more civilised.

'Pandu Rajar Dhibi' near Ajay river in the Burdwan district, represents the ruins of trading township, which carried on trade both internally and externally.

An inscription written in Brahmi script found in excavation at Mahasthana (formerly known as Pundranagar) in Bogra district is the earliest epigraphic record in Bangladesh and it bears testimony of Maurya rule ( 3rd century B.C.).

The Brahmi script bears evidence of using relief measures such as paddy and money in times of calamities, strong mutual respect between administration and people, weaving fine cotton, terracota plaques.

# Gupta Rule

From the fall of the Mauryas( 2nd century B.C.) to the rise of the Guptas ( 4th century A.D.) Bengal continued to flourish in the Sunga and Kushna periods, that is ascertained by terracotta figurines found at Mahasthana, Tamralipti, and Chandraketugarh.

Circa 4th century A.D. , Under Gupta founder Samudragupta, Bengal remained divided into independent states. Around 450 A.D., all these states came under Samudragupta's rule except Samatata, which was a tributary state.

Chandragupta II ( successor of Samudragupta ) consolidated all their possessions in the east and wage wars against the Vangas.

Proper administration was present during Gupta rule, in which participation of local people in administrative tasks was encouraged.

Under a central government, peace, wealth, prosperity and political stability was ensured.

Trade and commerce also flourished during Gupta empire. The discovery of large number of Gupta coins bear testimony of economic prosperity.

Religion tolerance and coexistence of religious beliefs (Buddism, Jainism) is an unprecendent  
achievement of Gupta empire.

Artistic excellence of the Gupta School inspired the Bengal school of scruptural art.
